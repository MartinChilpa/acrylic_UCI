<p>Re: <strong>Master Recording and Compositions Synchronization Representation Agreement</strong></p>

<p>Gentlepersons:</p>

<p>This letter agreement (the “Agreement”) sets forth the material terms of the agreement between {{ legal_name }} (hereinafter “Licensor”, “you” and “your”) on the one hand and Acrylic.la, Inc (“Company”) on the other.</p>

<h2>1. Engagement:</h2>

<p clas="l1">
	<span>(a)</span>
	During the Term, in the Territory, you hereby authorize and appoint Company to be your representative for the purpose of locating and exploiting, on the terms set forth herein, commercial licensing opportunities for all of the master recordings and compositions which are owned by you or your affiliates at any time during the Term and delivered to Company, the titles thereof are set forth on the Schedule A attached hereto (hereinafter, each a “Work,” collectively, the “Works”) which shall be updated from time to time as you deliver additional Works to Company, which upon delivery of each Work new shall be automatically added to the Schedule A and such Work shall be subject to this Agreement. Licensing opportunities shall include, without limitation, use of the Works within films, television productions, commercial advertisements, documentaries, soundtracks, compilation albums, interactive media and software, and video games (the aforementioned uses being hereinafter referred to as “Synch Uses”).  The rights in the Works to be licensed hereunder, together with the right to license the non-exclusive use of your name and approved likeness in conjunction with such rights, are collectively referred to herein as the “Rights.”  It is understood and agreed that Company’s representation rights hereunder extend to Company having the right to grant worldwide licenses of the Works for Synch Uses, provided the relevant licensing opportunity originates in the Territory.  In the event you enter into an agreement for exclusive services as a recording artist with a third-party recording label, you will cause such agreement to include an acknowledgement of this agreement, including Company’s rights and entitlements hereunder, subject subparagraphs 2(b) and 2(c) below. </p>
</p>
<p clas="l1">
	<span>(b)</span>
	For web-based, automated checkout licensing, Company shall exclusively represent Licensor’s Works for such licensing pursuant to the terms set forth on Company’s website(s). At no time during the Term shall the Licensor deliver the Works or any other Compositions or Masters to a third-party web-based licensing company who license via a digital or automated outlet. In connection with such web-based licensing, Licensor grants to Company the right to stream the Works on Company’s website on a gratis basis. At no time while this Agreement is in effect shall the Licensor deliver any Works to other web-based licensing companies who license via a digital or automated outlet.</p>
</p>
<p clas="l1">
	<span>(c)</span>
	For all other licensing opportunities outside the scope of Company’s onsite options, whereby licenses are required to be secured ‘offsite,’ that is, not through the automated checkout process via Company’s website(s), Company shall non-exclusively represent the Works.</p>
</p>
<p clas="l1">
	<span>(d)</span>
	Licenses shall only be subject to Licensor’s written approval when uses of the Works involve (i) use in a film or television program which, at the time of the license, Company knows bears or will bear a rating of “NC-17”, “X” or the equivalent, (ii) use in a political campaign or advertisement relating to a political campaign or (iii) use in a commercial for alcohol, tobacco, firearms or personal hygiene product.
</p>

<h2>2. Royalties:</h2>

<p>Licensor agrees to pay Company on any and all fees and royalties derived from the efforts of Company, including but not limited to master use license fees, synchronization fees, soundtrack album advances, and any other fees and royalties derived from direct efforts of Company. Company shall pay Licensor the following royalty splits of Net Receipts (as defined in paragraph 3(d)) with respect to any Secured Use (as defined in paragraph 3(e)), as provided below.</p>

</p>
<p clas="l1">
	<span>(a)</span>
	Synchronization Royalties: For any Secured Use synchronization license(s), Licensor shall be entitled to receive FIFTY PERCENT (50%) of the Net Receipts. The Composition and Master shall be licensed and paid on an equal basis.
</p>
</p>
<p clas="l1">
	<span>(b)</span>
	Non-Synchronization Royalties: For all other Secured Use non-synchronization royalties, including, mechanical, performance, print, master use and other income derived from soundtracks, secured compilations and other Secured Use, Licensor shall be entitled to receive FIFTY PERCENT (50%) of the Net Receipts. The Composition and Master shall be licensed and paid on an equal basis, as applicable.
</p>
<p clas="l1">
	<span>(c)</span>
  All royalty payments will be prorated to reflect Licensor’s actual ownership of an applicable Composition and/or Master.
</p>
<p clas="l1">
	<span>(d)</span>
  “Net Receipts” shall mean the gross amounts actually received by Company in the US, after deduction of (i) any actual, out of pocket non- overhead costs or expenses and (ii) exploitation costs or expenses. For avoidance of doubt, all royalty payments will be prorated to reflect Licensor’s actual ownership of an applicable Composition and/or Master. Company’s rights to collect monies shall include the right to collect any sums for extensions and/or replacements of any applicable licenses, option fees, advances, royalties and residuals.
</p>
<p clas="l1">
	<span>(e)</span>
  “Secured Use” shall mean any use, license and/or income (i) secured by Company in relation to any Composition and/or Master, and/or (ii) licensed to any customer, client or licensing party that is currently or formerly serviced by Company.
</p>
<p clas="l1">
	<span>(f)</span>
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to Licensor: (i)  in conjunction with each new release by Licensor, but no less than once per month, sharing links on its social media accounts (Instagram, X, etc.) to Licensor’s profile on Company’s website (the “Licensor’s Profile”); (ii) displaying links to Licensor’s Profile anywhere Licensor displays links to its Spotify profile (or other DSP profiles, including, but not limited to on multi-store links such as Linkfire and Feature.FM; and, (iii) displaying a “We Are With Acrylic” video short or similar promotional video on Licensor’s social media accounts within two (2) weeks of the Effective Date (collectively, the “Promotional Services”), your share of the Net Receipts payable to Licensor pursuant to paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) above shall be increased to Seventy Percent (70%).
</p>
<p clas="l1">
	<span>(g)</span>
  For the avoidance of doubt, Company, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to immediately discontinue payment of the increased payments of Net Receipts pursuant to paragraph 2(f) in the event Licensor does not fully perform the Promotional Services.
</p>

<h2>3. Additional Terms/ Subscription Catalog:</h2>

<p>Company may elect at a later date for the Works to be included in Company’s “Subscription Catalog”, made up of the Works and similar material from third party licensors, for potential licenses under a so-called “Membership” or “Subscription” format where a licensee pays a monthly subscription fee to Company to access to Company’s library of works (which may, at Company’s sole election, be inclusive of the Works). In such an event, you and Company agree to enter into good faith negotiation to amend this Agreement to include any additional terms in connection with such additional exploitations of the Works by Company.</p>

<h2>4. Payments:</h2>

</p>
<p clas="l1">
	<span>(a)</span>
  Payments will be based on actual money received by Company. Company agrees to render accounting statements to Licensor, as to amounts due Licensor, if any, on a quarterly basis on or around the tenth (10th) day of any new quarter, which shall include amounts received by Company during the preceding quarter. This accounting period may be changed from time to time in Company’s sole discretion. No payment will be due unless the Works are actually used and payments are received by Company. In the event that the Works are used, Licensor will be paid after Company receives such payment.
</p>
<p clas="l1">
	<span>(b)</span>
  In the event any royalties related to any Secured Use is sent to Licensor, then Licensor warrants and represents that it shall forward copies of all statements for the Works along with any and all payment due to Company for its share of royalties that are derived from any and all Secured Uses. Such statements and payments must be sent to Company at the address above within thirty (30) days of Licensor’s receipt of such royalties. Company shall have the right to audit all royalties and statements related to uses secured by Company. Timely payment of Company’s share of royalties received by Licensor is of the essence of this Agreement.
</p>

<h2>5. Fees:</h2>
<p>
  During the Term, Licensor shall pay to Company a subscription service fee as follows: (a) Ten Dollars ($10.00) per each month of the Term during which your royalty account is credited with at least Forty Dollars ($40.00) in royalties; or, (b) a prepayment of Ninety Nine Dollars ($99.00) payable at the beginning of each year of the Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, any  fees which may be payable to Company pursuant to paragraph 5(a) may be deducted from any royalties payable to you hereunder.
</p>

<h2>6. Term and Termination:</h2>
